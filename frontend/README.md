# TaskHub Client

## Running locally
1. Create a file called `.env` and add the following environment variables:
- `REACT_APP_TOKEN=...` (where `...` can be any string)
- `REACT_APP_PROFILE_ID=...` (where `...` can be any string, note: this must be a different string to `REACT_APP_TOKEN`)
- `REACT_APP_API_URL=...` (where `...` is the URL of the running server, by default, we have this set to `http://localhost:7777`)
2. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start application.

The client will be hosted locally @ http://localhost:3000.
