Week 1
Group was formed. Jira accounts were created. As a group we started on the proposal, wrote some user stories, brainstormed some novel ideas and started the user flow diagram. We have allocated front-end and back-end groups for the project - the back-end will be written using spring boot java with a react front-end.

Week 2
Continued to work on the proposal, and created tickets on Jira for the user stories that we have. The group decided a name for the project, and decided on the novel ideas for the project. GitHub classroom was created.
